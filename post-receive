# An example hook script for the "post-receive" event.
#
# The "post-receive" script is run after receive-pack has accepted a pack
# and the repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through
# stdin in the form
#  <oldrev> <newrev> <refname>
# For example:
#  aa453216d1b3e49e7f6f98441fa56946ddcd6a20 68f7abf4e6f922807889f52bc043ecd31b79f814 refs/heads/master

while read oldrev newrev refname
do
    if [ "$refname" == "refs/heads/master" ]; then
        break;  
    fi  
done

if [ "$refname" != "refs/heads/master" ]; then
    exit;
